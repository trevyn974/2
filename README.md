## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This tool is for educational purposes only. The current implementation uses simulated data as TikTok's official API requires authentication and may have usage restrictions. For production use, you would need to:

1. Obtain proper TikTok API credentials
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Respect TikTok's Terms of Service and rate limits
4. Consider using official TikTok Research API or third-party services

## Legal Considerations

- Always respect TikTok's Terms of Service
- Ensure you have permission to extract data from profiles
- Consider rate limiting to avoid overwhelming TikTok's servers
- Use this tool responsibly and ethically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid username or URL format"**
   - Make sure the username doesn't contain special characters
   - Try different URL formats

2. **"No songs to export"**
   - Ensure the extraction completed successfully
   - Check if the profile has videos with music

3. **GUI not responding**
   - The extraction runs in a separate thread
   - Wait for the process to complete

## Development

To extend this tool:

1. Implement real TikTok API integration
2. Add more export formats
3. Add batch processing for multiple profiles
4. Implement caching to avoid re-extracting data
5. Add filtering options (date range, song duration, etc.)
